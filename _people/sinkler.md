Craig came to the Caylor Lab as a rising senior from <a href="http://www.rider.edu/" target="_blank">Rider University</a>, majoring in Environmental Science and minoring in Biology. In the summer of 2014, Craig worked with <a href="http://caylor.eri.ucsb.edu/portfolio-item/cynthia-gerlein-phd-student-2/" target="_blank">Cynthia</a>, looking at foliar uptake in Colocasia Esculenta using isotopically labelled water and an array of isotope analysis. Craig also helped <a href="http://caylor.eri.ucsb.edu/portfolio-item/adam-wolf-postdoctoral-research-associate/" target="_blank">Adam</a> with the fieldwork at Silas Little, as you can see in the picture on the left.

Craig is now working for the environmental consulting group <span class="s1"><a href="http://www.earthres.com/" target="_blank">EarthRes</a>.</span>
