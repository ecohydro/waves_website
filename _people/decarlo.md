Keita joined the Caylor Lab in Fall 2013 after completing his studies at Boston University.  His prior research involved the digital image processing of desiccation crack networks in clay to understand its physicochemical properties.  In his  work at Princeton, he  analyzed soil phenomena and investigated their consequences on larger-scale hydrological processes in dryland environments.
