Patrick joined the Caylor lab in 2011 after majoring in Environmental Engineering and Science of Earth Systems at Cornell University. At Princeton Patrick is hoping to apply his interests in soil science, environmental chemistry, and hydrology to addressing issues of environmental degradation and underdevelopment, especially in Africa.
  
As a Rochester native and lifelong upstate New York resident Patrick is looking forward to exploring New Jersey, particularly the local hiking, camping, and nordic skiing.
