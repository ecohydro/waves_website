<span class="s1">In Summer 2011, Stephanie joined the Caylor Lab and conducted fieldwork in agricultural villages in Zambia. After passing her General Exams, she began her thesis work by interning at NASA Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, California for Summer 2013 with Dr. Thomas Fuchs in the Computer Vision Group. Her research focuses on using computer vision and machine learning to better understand food security and agricultural development in Sub-Saharan Africa. In particular, she works on algorithms to quantify the spatial distribution of agriculture from satellite images. Stephanie is also a Graduate Fellow in the Program in Science, Technology, and Environmental Policy through the Princeton Environmental Institute and the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.</span>
