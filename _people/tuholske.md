His first objective assesses household-level socioeconomic predictors of food consumption and expenditures within Accra, Ghana, and Lusaka, Zambia, with the goal to understand urban food security challenges in Sub-Saharan African cities. Second, his research uses integrated demographic and remote-sensed data to understand how climate change may be driving urbanization in Sub-Saharan Africa.
