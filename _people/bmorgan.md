Bryn is a Ph.D. student in the WAVES Lab at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Her research interests include vegetation water use, dynamics of dryland rivers, and UAV-based remote sensing for scientific pursuits and environmental conservation. 

She is currently working on estimating evapotranspiration from thermal imagery and eddy covariance towers at the [Mpala Research Centre]( https://mpala.org) in Kenya and at the [Dangermond Preserve]( https://www.nature.org/en-us/newsroom/the-nature-conservancy-preserves-24000-acre-coastal-ranch-at-point-conceptio/), as well as modeling hydrological processes in [riparian environments]( https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2018/018656/champions-forests) for application in the Southwestern U.S. and southern France. Bryn is also involved in an indoor cartography project, where she is using LiDAR- and Structure-from-Motion-based point clouds to resolve tree canopy geometry.

Prior to UCSB, Bryn worked as a remote sensing analyst at the Namibian Chamber of Environment in Windhoek, Namibia, working on a [wildlife aerial survey program](https://www.n-c-e.org/resource/eye-sky-game-counts). She earned a bachelorâ€™s degree in geography and chemistry from Dartmouth College in 2017.
