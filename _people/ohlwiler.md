Caden is an MAE major in the class of 2015. He first joined the lab in the fall of 2012 and quickly took the lead on the mechanical design of a custom dendrometer as well as in getting our new 3-D printer up and running. This summer he will continue his prototyping work by focusing on the design and construction of a leaf chamber.
