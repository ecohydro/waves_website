Moses was first an intern at Mpala with Corinna Riginos in mid-2011, and joined out team in January 2012 along with Boniface. Trained in rangeland health monitoring, Moses has become familiar with our soil and vegetation monitoring techniques. He has also picked up the slack on some data and document management duties. Moses was advised by Professor Jesse Njoka of the University of Nairobiâ€™s Center for Sustainable Dryland Ecosystems and Societies.
