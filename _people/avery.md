Ryan joined the WAVES Lab in Fall 2017. Prior to UCSB, Ryan graduated from UC Berkeley in 2016 and then served as a Geoinformatics Fellow with the NASA DEVELOP program. He advised applied remote sensing projects and helped develop a time series of [forest disturbance maps](https://develop.larc.nasa.gov/2017/spring/GlacierNationalParkClimateII.html) for Glacier National Park and a [python program](https://develop.larc.nasa.gov/2017/summer/WyomingCrossII.html) to model regional light pollution for the Natural Sounds and Night Skies division of the National Park Service. 

His research interests include modeling of hydrologic processes, remote sensing of land cover/land use change, and the applications of machine learning in the geographic sciences. Ryan is currently applying these methodologies to model plant water-use using stable isotopes and micromet data, and to detect and classify smallholder agriculture in Ghana. When not researching, you can find him rock climbing, biking, trail running, or getting a sunburn.

He also serves as an instructor for [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/).
