Daozhi is from the Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development in Agriculture from the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science and spent the academic year 2013/2014 as a visiting research fellow in the Ecohydrology Lab. His research focuses on hydrological processes associated with crop production in water-limited environments. His interests involve water transportation mechanism in soil-plant-atmosphere continuum, crop water production model and cropping decision system. His goal is to explore the coupled mechanisms of crop growth and water movement in SPAC by means of observations and mathematic models. His current focus is on partitioning of crop water use (evapotranspiration, ET) into unproductive (soil evaporation, E) and productive (plant transpiration, T) components. He is working on developing a set of methods for separating E and T at hourly scale with isotopic and eddy covariance measurements.
