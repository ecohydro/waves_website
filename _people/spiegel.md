  Marcus Spiegel is a sophomore in the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department.  He was a Grand Challenges Intern in summer 2014 working with <a href="http://caylor.eri.ucsb.edu/portfolio-item/keita-decarlo-phd-student/" target="_blank">Keita DeCarlo</a> on the biological controls of soil cracking in a Kenyan dryland system.</p>

<p>
  In the Spring of 2015, Marcus received a <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/pei/undergrads/pei-environmental-scholar/" target="_blank">Smith-Newton Scholarship</a> from the Princeton Environmental Institute to conduct his own research project within the Ecohydrology Lab. Marcus will be modeling agricultural expansion in Zambia, including fieldwork and remote sensing data into his analysis.
