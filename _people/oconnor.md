Molly first got involved in our group as a summer intern, excavating tree root systems with Frances in Botswana during the summer of 2009. She went on to participate in the Semester in Kenya program, and worked the Mpala Research Center in the summer of 2010, collecting data for her senior thesis, which explored the idea that mutualistic ant responses to herbivory are dependent on the nature of background canopy vibrations induced by properties of surface turbulence. She spent 2011 working with our group at the Mpala Research center as our chief instrumentation/calibration/and operational guru for our flux tower. From 2012-2013 she helped develop new hydrological sensors for our PULSE lab as well as helped out with flux data management and generally everything else. Molly now lives in sunny southern California, where she is working on the data team for [Factual software](http://www.factual.com).
