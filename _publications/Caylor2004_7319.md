**Abstract**: ECOHYDROLOGICAL PATTERN AND PROCESS IN SAVANNA LANDSCAPES Semi-arid ecosystems (most notably savannas), exhibit a number of characteristics relevant to the investigation of unresolved issues in spatial ecology and the interface between ecology and surface hydrology. Although savannas are variously defined, they can be generally described as mixed life-form vegetation communities in which woody and herbaceous components co-dominate (Bourliere and Hadley, 1970; Walter, 1971; Sarmiento, 1984; Tothill and Mott, 1985). This pronounced functional diversity in the form of tree/grass coexistence is a most striking characteristic of savannas. The ability of savannas to maintain this functional diversity is likely linked to the role of small-scale spatial heterogeneity in resource availability and strong interactions between biotic and abiotic determinants of soil moisture and nitrogen availability. The ecological relevance of savannas has encouraged many studies and theories regarding the nature of spatial patterns in savanna structure and the consequences of savanna structural pattern on the dynamics of savanna vegetation.
