**Abstract**: Integrating physical processes with machine learning has advanced evapotranspiration (ET) simulation, yet most
hybrid models fail to partition total ET into its components: soil evaporation (E) and vegetation transpiration (T).
This study introduces Residual Neural Network–Penman–Monteith (RNN-PM), a novel hybrid dual-source ET
model designed to overcome this limitation. The model synergizes the physically-based Penman–Monteith
framework with three specialized residual neural networks trained to estimate key conductance parameters
(canopy conductance, soil surface conductance, and aerodynamic conductance). This explicit parameterization
allows for the direct partitioning of total ET. Validation at National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) flux
sites using high-frequency partitioned E and T shows that RNN-PM reliably reproduces ET and the transpiration
fraction (T/ET). For ET, the model achieves an average Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE) of 0.89 and a root-mean-
square error (RMSE) of 0.55 mm/day; for T/ET, the KGE is 0.87 with an RMSE of 0.06. Furthermore, RNN-PM
demonstrates robust generalization, accurately simulating ET and its components well beyond the initial training
dataset, even under extreme climatic conditions. This study extended the analysis by comparing the RNN-PM
model with seven established dual-source ET models. The results indicate that RNN-PM outperforms both conventional
machine learning models and purely physical process-based models in simulating ET components in
most cases. Among the purely physical process-based dual-source models, those based on surface temperature
decomposition showed improved performance as the leaf area index (LAI) decreased when evaluated against
high-frequency ET component datasets. In contrast, the performance of conductance-based dual-source models
declined with decreasing LAI. Although purely machine learning-based models can produce relatively accurate
simulations of ET components, they often exhibit limited generalization capability, an issue that the RNN-PM
model effectively overcomes. Ultimately, the RNN-PM model represents a significant advance in simulating ET
components, offering a novel and scalable approach for improving the representation of land–atmosphere interactions
in Earth system models.
