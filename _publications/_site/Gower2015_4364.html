<p>The common hippopotamus,
<i>
 Hippopotamus amphibius
</i>
, transports millions of tons of organic matter annually from its terrestrial feeding grounds into aquatic habitats. We evaluated whether carbon stable isotopes (δ
<sup>
 13
</sup>
C) can be used as tracers for determining whether
<i>
 H. amphibius
</i>
-vectored allochthonous material is utilized by aquatic consumers. Two approaches were employed to make this determination: (1) lab-based feeding trials where omnivorous river fish were fed a
<i>
 H. amphibius
</i>
dung diet and (2) field sampling of fish and aquatic insects in pools with and without
<i>
 H. amphibius
</i>
. Lab trials revealed that fish fed exclusively
<i>
 H. amphibius
</i>
dung exhibited significantly more positive δ
<sup>
 13
</sup>
C values than fish not fed dung. Fish and aquatic insects sampled in a river pool used for decades by
<i>
 H. amphibius
</i>
also exhibited more positive δ
<sup>
 13
</sup>
C values at the end of the dry season than fish and insects sampled from an upstream
<i>
 H. amphibius
</i>
-free reference pool. Fish sampled in these same pools at the end of the wet season (high flow) showed no significant differences in δ
<sup>
 13
</sup>
C values, suggesting that higher flows reduced retention and use of
<i>
 H. amphibius
</i>
subsidies. These data provide preliminary evidence that δ
<sup>
 13
</sup>
C values may be useful, in certain contexts, for quantifying the importance
<i>
 H. amphibius
</i>
organic matter.</p>
