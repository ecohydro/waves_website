**Abstract**: The spatial pattern of vegetation is both a cause and effect of variation in resource availability in semiarid ecosystems. At landscape to regional scales, climatic and geologic constraints on soil moisture and nutrient availability are primary determinants of vegetation structural pattern in semiarid ecosystems. Similarly, at local to landscape scales, the patchy vegetation structural mosaic serves to redistribute the availability of soil moisture and nutrients in ways that have important consequences for structural dynamics and community composition.
The investigation of vegetation organization as a means to understand underlying patterns in the environment originates in the first ecological writings and continues throughout the history of the discipline. Theophrastus (3rd Century BC) observed the distribution of deciduousness and evergreenness with respect to climate (Hort, 1916; Morton, 1981) and experimentally transplanted plants to areas outside their natural range to determine if they would grow (or flower). The pioneering work of the early American ecologist, Henry Chandler Cowles (Cowles, 1899) documented the succession of vegetation as the cause of spatial variation in composition observed across dune formations of different ages. In this work, Cowles anticipated both the individualistic nature of the response of plant species to their environments (eg Gleason, 1927) and the “continuum concept” of species distribution along environmental gradients (McIntosh, 1967; Austin, 1985). Indeed, the historical foundation of plant ecology in biogeography (Humboldt, 1807) is itself an indication of the critical interactions between the large-scale spatial organization of the physical environment and the distribution of vegetation in the landscape. These same relationships were observed 3 millennia earlier by Theophrastus, who noted the positive relationship between altitude and latitude with respect to their climates and vegetation.
