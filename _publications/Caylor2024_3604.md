**Abstract**: In the context of rising global temperatures and their impact on weather patterns and water cycles, understanding the relationship between vegetation and hydroclimatic forcing is critical. Riparian forests are highly vulnerable to hydroclimatic variability, which can significantly affect water availability in the soil on which they primarily depend. Along large rivers, hydroclimatic forcings can vary, resulting in different vegetative responses depending on the local climatic context and site conditions. To explore this, we studied riparian forest greenness along a 512‐km river corridor with a 3° latitudinal gradient, analysing the relative contributions of climate (latitude, season, temperature, precipitation) and local hydrological conditions (groundwater). Here, we show that riparian forests along a latitudinal gradient respond differently to hydroclimatic controls, with vegetative dynamics that can be attenuated or accentuated by local site conditions. We combined Sentinel‐2 satellite Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data over seven years (2016–2022) with hydroclimatic data to examine riparian forest greenness responses to latitudinal, seasonal and interannual hydroclimatic variability. We found contrasting hydroclimatic controls across the latitudinal gradient, with the northernmost sites predominantly controlled by temperature, while those further south are limited by water availability. In addition, we identified temperature as the primary driver of NDVI throughout the growing season, either positively or negatively. Late season precipitation and high phreatic water availability positively influenced NDVI, emphasising the role of local conditions in governing riparian forest resilience. This study enhances understanding of climate controls on riparian tree greenness, which is critical for designing effective landscape‐scale riparian ecosystem management and restoration strategies.
