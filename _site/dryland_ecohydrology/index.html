<p>Our drylands research is focused on understanding how rainfall variability affects ecosystem processes and the provision of ecosystem services. We are particulary interested in understand the critical role that coupled spatial patterns of plants, soils, and resources play in determining the dynamics and resilience of dryland ecosystems. Our work in these areas seeks to combine field observations, computational modeling, and development of new concepts and theories.</p>
