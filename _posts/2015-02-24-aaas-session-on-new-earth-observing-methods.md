<a href="http://caylor.eri.ucsb.edu/portfolio-item/lyndon-estes/" target="_blank">Lyndon Estes</a> and <a href="http://caylor.eri.ucsb.edu/portfolio-item/kelly-caylor-associate-professor/" target="_blank">Kelly Caylor</a> recently came back from San Jose, where they attended the AAAS 2015 Annual Meeting to convene a session on “[Advances in Earth Observation: Enabling New Insights into Global Environmental Change](https://aaas.confex.com/aaas/2015/webprogram/Session9691.html)“.<!--more--> The session featured [Matt Hansen](http://geog.umd.edu/facultyprofile/Hansen/Matthew%20C.) and [Maggi Kelly](http://kellylab.berkeley.edu/). The goal of the session was to illustrate how new methods and hardware, such as advanced parallel processing, in-field environmental sensors, and data integration platforms, are starting to fill in the spatial and temporal gaps in our current abilities to observe ecological processes. They had a pretty nice turnout, despite the fact that they were scheduled for 8 am on Sunday morning!
