&#8220;Climate change must not blow conservation off course&#8221;, by [Morgan Tingley](http://www.morgantingley.com/), [Lyndon]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _people/estes.md %}), and [David Wilcove](https://www.princeton.edu/step/people/faculty/david-wilcove/) was published in the comment section of this week&#8217;s _[Nature](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v500/n7462/index.html)._ <!--more--> The article calls for conservationists to not reconfigure their priorities (e.g. protected area design) around climate change, because 1) traditional threats such as habitat destruction are more certain and urgent, 2) it would result in rugged, more mountainous areas being conserved at the expense of flatter, lower-lying habitats (this geographic bias already exists among current protected areas), and 3) species&#8217; and communities&#8217; responses to climate change [are hard to predict, and often counter-intuitive](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2012.02784.x/abstract).
