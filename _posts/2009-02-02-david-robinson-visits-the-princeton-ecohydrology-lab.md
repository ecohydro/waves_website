![Savanna Scene]({{ "/assets/uploads/2013/04/shapeimage_1-141.png" | absolute_url }}){: .align-right} The Ecohydrology lab group was pleased to host David Robinson for a visit to Princeton University. David gave a seminar on his recent research regarding the use of electromagnetic geophysical instruments for conductivity surveys of soil texture, salinity, and water content. David also spent a lot of time with Trenton Franz helping Trenton prepare for his upcoming field work using a DUAL-EM system to map patterns of soil properties at the hillslope scale at his sites in and around the Mpala Research Center in Kenya. Weâ€™re extremely glad that David was able to come up and brave our NJ winter and were hoping to get more involved with David and his research in tropical systems&#8230; especially visiting him in Trinidad & Tobago sometime soon!
