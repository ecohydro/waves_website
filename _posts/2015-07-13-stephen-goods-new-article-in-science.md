Former lab member <a href="http://caylor.eri.ucsb.edu/portfolio-item/stephen-good/" target="_blank">Stephen Good</a> just published an <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/349/6244/175" target="_blank">article in Science</a>.<!--more--> For this paper, Stephen and his collaborators used water vapor isotope data from <a href="http://tes.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">TES</a> along with other datasets, like the <a href="http://precip.gsfc.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">GPCP</a> and <a href="http://oaflux.whoi.edu/" target="_blank">OAFlux</a>, to provide a global estimate of evapo-transpiration partitioning. While the details can be found in the paper, the general result is that: 64 % of the water is transpired by vegetation • 6 % evaporates from soils • 3 % evaporates from lakes, streams and rivers • The other 27 % are being intercepted by vegetation.

The article is already getting some press around the www (see <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-07/uou-wdw062915.php" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/07/150709141308.htm" target="_blank">here</a> or [here](http://phys.org/news/2015-07-doesnt.html)), and will without doubt be a key study for future research on ecohydrology at the global scale. A good summary of the article is also provided in the <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org.ezproxy.princeton.edu/content/349/6244/138.summary" target="_blank">&#8220;perspective&#8221; article by Renee Brooks</a>, published in the same issue of Science.
