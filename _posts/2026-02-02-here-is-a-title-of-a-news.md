Thank you for your submission to Earth's Future. Based on my reading of the manuscript relative to a large number of other submissions, I conclude that the content of your manuscript, "sdfsdfd" does not represent a transdisciplinary contribution or engage a broad suite of stakeholders in a manner that meets the aims and scope of Earth's Future. Therefore, I regret to inform you that I cannot consider the manuscript further for publication in Earth's Future. 

Earth's Future has a particular mission within the AGU portfolio, so we must, unfortunately, reject many good papers, including those without review. Although the manuscript appears publishable in a more narrowly focused journal, my ultimate determination is that the work is neither sufficiently innovative nor broad enough to meet the Earth's Future criteria. Again, my decision does not reflect a judgment on the quality of your work, but I think the focus of the material is better suited for another journal. 

I am sorry I cannot provide better news in this case.

You will receive an email with a link to an online survey regarding your experience with the peer review process for this submission. Your comments will help us improve AGU journals and service to authors.

Sincerely,

Kelly Caylor
Editor in Chief
Earth's Future
