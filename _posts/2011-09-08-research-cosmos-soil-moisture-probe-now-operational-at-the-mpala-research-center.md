![COSMOS Map]({{ "/assets/uploads/2013/03/Explaining-SM-probes.jpg" | absolute_url }}){: .align-left} Our first of two COSMOS probes (and the first probe deployed in Africa) is now operational at our flux tower site located at the Mpala Research Center in central Kenya. Here’s a link to the real-time probe data (currently uncalibrated):

We’re excited about this new observation, as it will provide us with landscape-scale observations of soil moisture within (and beyond) our flux tower footprint. The COSMOS project is run by the University of Arizona, and former Caylor lab member Trenton Franz is a postdoctoral research associate working on probe deployment and calibration. Thanks Trenton for your help getting this probe to our site!
