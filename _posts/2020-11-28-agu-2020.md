This year flew by and has been rife with challenges, loss and uncertainty. Hopefully a virtual format for AGU will present the opportunity to share research and visit with friends and colleagues from the comfort of our WFH set-ups. Here's the WAVES Lab line up for AGU talks and posters. Catch us virtually!
