Over the past week, [Kelly]({{ "/people/caylor" | absolute_url }}), [Adam]({{ "/people/wolf" | absolute_url }}), [Molly]({{ "/people/oconnor" | absolute_url }}), [Cynthia]({{ "/people/gerlein-safdi" | absolute_url }}) and the undergraduate students who will be working in the lab this summer all took a two-days long tree climbing class. Being able to climb trees will allow them to take measurements high up in the canopy during this summer&#8217;s field work.
