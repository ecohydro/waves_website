[Kaiyu Guan]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _people/guan.md %}),[Kelly Caylor]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _people/caylor.md %}) and [Adam Wolf]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _people/wolf.md %}) recently published an <a href="http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo2382.html" target="_blank">article</a> in <a href="http://www.nature.com/ngeo/index.html" target="_blank">Nature Geoscience</a> and the article is currently on the front page of the journal&#8217;s website.<!--more--> The article investigates the decline in forest productivity associated with drought. The authors conclude that water availability exerts a first-order control on vegetation seasonality in tropical forests globally and that their proposed framework can help identify where tropical forests may be vulnerable or resilient to future hydroclimaticÂ changes.
