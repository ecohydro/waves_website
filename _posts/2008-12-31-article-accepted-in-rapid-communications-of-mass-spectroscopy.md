![MMSF Lab]({{ "/assets/uploads/2013/04/shapeimage_1-16.png" | absolute_url }}){: .align-right} Our group’s first manuscript using the LGR Water Vapor Isotope Analyzer has been accepted for publication in the journal “Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry”. Lixin is the lead author, along with Kelly and Danilo Dragoni, who is our collaborator at the Morgan-Monroe State Forest site at Indiana University. 

The manuscript presents a new method for calibration of the WVIA using a dew point generator to create a vapor source of known isotopic composition from a liquid isotope standard. The manuscript should appear in an upcoming issue in the next few weeks.
