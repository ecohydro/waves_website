<a href="http://caylor.eri.ucsb.edu/portfolio-item/lyndon-estes/" target="_blank">Lyndon Estes</a> is the co-lead author on a <a href="http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate2584.html#close" target="_blank">paper</a> that was recently published in <a href="http://www.nature.com/nclimate/index.html" target="_blank">Nature Climate Change</a> and is currently highlighted on the front page of the journal. <!--more-->The article analyzes the climate costs of different lands relative to their potential food benefits and finds that converting Africa&#8217;s wet savannas into farmland would come at a high environmental cost and fail to meet some existing standards for renewable fuels.
