Two articles authored by members of our lab are appearing in the March 2013 issue of Ecosphere, a relatively new on-line only and open-access journal published by the Ecological Society of America. <!--more-->

The first article, led by CEE graduate student and Caylor Lab member Kaiyu Guan, uses both optical and microwave remote sensing to investigate the seasonality of vegetation canopy structure and function in three distinct tropical African forest types. Kaiyu&#8217;s results reveal differential couplings between canopy structure and function in tropical forests which highlights the differences inherent in distinct vegetation types within the tropics that may originate in the different life histories of their respective floras.

While all three regions are &#8220;tropical&#8221;, it&#8217;s clear that water availability strongly influences both structure and function even in areas where tropical forests are usually thought to be nutrient limited (eg. panels A and C). In addition, the seasonal variability in both structure and function of forests is smaller in at the equator and driven primarily by changes in seasonal radiation rather than rainfall. 

The research was a truly interdisciplinary effort. It was co-authored by Adam Wolf (Princeton, EEB), David Medvigy (Princeton, GEO), Kelly, Ming Pan, and Eric Wood (all in Princeton, CEE).
