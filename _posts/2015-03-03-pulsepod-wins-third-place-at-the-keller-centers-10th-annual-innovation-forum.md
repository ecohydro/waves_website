[Kelly]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _people/caylor.md %}) recently received the third place for the <a href="http://www.pulsepod.io/" target="_blank">PulsePod</a> at the <a href="http://kellercenter.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Keller Center</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://kellercenter.princeton.edu/engage/innovation-forum/overview/" target="_blank">10th annual Innovation Forum</a>.<!--more--> This event is the opportunity for University researchers to present potentially marketable discoveries. <a href="http://caylor.eri.ucsb.edu/portfolio-item/kelly-caylor-associate-professor/" target="_blank">Kelly</a> only had three minutes to convince the judges that the environmental sensing platform will indeed help empowering land managers to make better decisions about their resources. The <a href="http://www.pulsepod.io/" target="_blank">PulsePod</a> device is combination of hardware and software and provides in-field monitoring of crop health, microclimate, water and nutrients — information that is currently not easily available to farmers.

This year&#8217;s forum also included presentations on a new treatment for cancer, a possible solution to widespread water contamination and a type of laser that could diagnose diseases before any symptoms appear. The picture on the left shows this year&#8217;s winners (<a href="http://caylor.eri.ucsb.edu/portfolio-item/kelly-caylor-associate-professor/" target="_blank">Kelly</a> is in the middle of the second row).

This year was the tenth consecutive Innovation Forum and the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department has a long history of convincing innovators that their ideas are worth commercializing.
