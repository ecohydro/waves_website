Mount Kenya is one of the major water towers in Kenya, but with an increase in population and water demand, the pressure on this scare commodity has been on the rise. <!--more-->[Kelly Caylor]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _people/caylor.md %})
 and PhD student [Drew Gower]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _people/gower.md %})
, along with <a href="http://mypage.iu.edu/~evans/" target="_blank">Tom Evans</a> from Indiana University, have been working together on an extensive socio-hydrological research project, in which 752 households were surveyed on water related issues. In parallel, farmer water flows were surveyed weekly for six months, and the pipe networks mapped. The biophysical data was analyzed together with the social data in order to determine the efficiency of the water distribution, and the reasons behind flow variability.

To learn more about the project, check out <a href="https://vimeo.com/matteoobrien" target="_blank">Matteo Dell&#8217;Angelo</a>&#8216;s short film below, and read the full-length article in National Geographic <a href="http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2016/08/05/working-together-research-and-water-governance-on-mount-kenya/" target="_blank">HERE</a>.
