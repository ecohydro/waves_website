In December 2013, [Stephanie Debats](http://caylor.eri.ucsb.edu/portfolio-item/stephanie-debats-phd-student/) and [Drew Gower](http://caylor.eri.ucsb.edu/portfolio-item/drew-gower-phd-student/) attended the first meeting of an 18-month modeling workshop series through the [National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC)](http://www.sesync.org/) in Annapolis, Maryland. <!--more--> The workshop series is entitled &#8220;Towards Socio-Hydrologic Synthesis: Modeling the Co-Evolutionary Dynamics of Coupled Human, Water, & Ecological Systems&#8221;.

[Stephanie](http://caylor.eri.ucsb.edu/portfolio-item/stephanie-debats-phd-student/) and [Drew](http://caylor.eri.ucsb.edu/portfolio-item/drew-gower-phd-student/), along with other workshop participants, organized the Agent-Based Modeling Working Group, which will focus on incorporating decision-making of individuals, such as farmers, with hydrologic models. [Stephanie](http://caylor.eri.ucsb.edu/portfolio-item/stephanie-debats-phd-student/) aims to address coping strategies among rainfed smallholder farmers in Zambia, while [Drew](http://caylor.eri.ucsb.edu/portfolio-item/drew-gower-phd-student/) will study the effects of climate variability on small-scale irrigation systems in Kenya.
