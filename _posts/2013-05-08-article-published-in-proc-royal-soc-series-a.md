A chapter of [Stephen Good]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _people/good.md %})&#8216;s dissertation &#8211; Analytical expressions of variability in ecosystem structure and function obtained from three-dimensional stochastic vegetation modelling &#8211; has just been published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, Series A. We&#8217;re really excited about this work, as it focuses on deriving analytical expressions of the distribution of LAI within vegetation communities that vary in both density and spatial aggregation. <!--more-->

The derivation allows for direct estimation of how the spatial aggregation of vegetation alters landscape-scale fluxes such as evapotranspiration. This is a particularly detailed investigation of the Jensen inequality, which simply states that the average of a function is not equal to the function of the average when the function is non-linear. When applied to vegetation patterns, the Jensen inequality implies that models which use a single estimate of vegetation structure (i.e. &#8220;big leaf&#8221; or &#8220;green slime&#8221; models) will generate inaccurate fluxes if they are averaging over underlying structural heterogeneity. While that general finding has been well-documented across many ecosystems, Steve&#8217;s work is the first to analytically assess how the clumping of vegetation impacts the magnitude of inaccuracies due to spatial averaging. It&#8217;s really cool work, and the model provides a framework into a wide range of new problems related to spatial organization of vegetation and ecological/hydrological processes.
