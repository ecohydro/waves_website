<a href="http://caylor.eri.ucsb.edu/portfolio-item/adam-wolf-postdoctoral-research-associate/" target="_blank">Adam Wolf</a> from the Caylor Lab, along with researchers at Princeton University and other institutions, just published <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/349/6247/528" target="_blank">a new article in Science</a>. <!--more-->In this paper, the authors studied a tree-ring database of 1338 forest sites from around the globe. They found that forests exhibit a drought “legacy effect” with 3 to 4 years&#8217; reduced growth following drought. During this postdrought delay, forests will be less able to act as a sink for carbon. Incorporating forest legacy effects into Earth system models will provide more accurate predictions of the effects of drought on the global carbon cycle.

The paper was already featured in a series of news articles in the US and abroad, including <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/07/30/yet-another-way-that-climate-change-makes-itself-worse/" target="_blank">The Washington Post</a>, <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/forests-affected-drought-store-less-co2-assumed-climate-models-study-358442" target="_blank">Newsweek</a>, [Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/30/climatechange-forests-science-idUSL5N10A40L20150730) or <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/forests-suck-up-less-carbon-after-drought/" target="_blank">Scientific American</a>.
