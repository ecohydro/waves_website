# subtitle: Installing an Arable Mark in some village. 


WAVES lab members Kelly and Natasha teamed up with Arable Labs and Zambia's Agricultural Research Institute to install close to 60 <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/mmg_disp.jsp?med_id=82037&from=
" target="_blank">  Internet of Things devices </a> in the southern province of Zambia. Supported by a National Science Foundation Water Sustainanability and Climate grant, this research seeks to understand climate variability impacts on smallholder agriculture in Zambia and Kenya. By coupling social information collected via SMS and environmental monitoring and measuring via low-cost solar-powered environmental sensors, we can better understand intraseasonal farmer decision-making. 

Arable Labs recently highlighted our work on their <a href="https://medium.com/@ArableLabs/how-4m-in-nsf-funded-work-fills-data-gap-to-improve-farmers-climate-adaptation-9553efc37859" target="_blank"> blog. </a>
