PhD student <a href="https://caylor.eri.ucsb.edu/portfolio-item/cynthia-gerlein-phd-student-2/" target="_blank">Cynthia Gerlein-Safdi</a> was recently awarded a 1-year award from the NASA Jet Propulsion Lab’s <a href="http://surp.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">Strategic University Research Partnership</a> program!<!--more-->  These grants provide up to $100,000 for cutting edge earth science research conducted by JPL scientists and their chosen collaborators at one of JPL’s 12 partnering universities.

For this project, Cynthia will be collaborating with <a href="http://www.davidraythompson.com/" target="_blank">David Thompson</a> from JPL. They plan to combine QuikSCAT active microwave remote sensing data with the <a href="http://aviris-ng.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">AVIRIS Next Generation</a> data over California to advance remote sensing of tree canopy water, improving our ability to map ecophysiology, water stress, drought response, and fire risk.
