A new Princeton freshman seminar on science, society and food was launched this semester.<!--more--> The class, officially titled &#8220;Science, Society & Dinner&#8221;, is taught by [Kelly Caylor]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _people/caylor.md %}), in collaboration with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/craig-shelton-2bb1686" target="_blank">Chef Craig Shelton</a>, and with assistance from Rozalie Czesana &#8217;18 and <a href="http://www.homemadecook.com/index.html" target="_blank">Chef Michelle Fuerst</a>.

A few pictures of the first class are available below. In that class, s<span class="s1">tudents learned about challenges of food security, production consumption and waste in the US, China, India and Brazil. They also practiced knife skills and tasted fresh-baked baguettes with Beurre d’Isigny from <a href="http://www.bonappetitfinefoods.com/" target="_blank">Bon Appetit</a> and sampled five varieties of salt from the <a href="http://www.savoryspiceshop.com/?gclid=COfglper4coCFYJehgod8_kOkg" target="_blank">Savory Spice Shop</a> in Princeton. They also sampled a non-alcoholic wine before and after lemon, sugar, black pepper and bleu cheese to note effects on perceived flavor.</span>

  <span class="s1">A takeaway: Understand ingredients to use them well and wisely &#8211; reducing waste in the process.</span>
