![ESA Logo]({{ "/assets/uploads/2013/04/shapeimage_1-20.png" | absolute_url }}){: .align-left} Members of our group gave two presentations at the Ecological Society of America meeting in Milwaukee, WI. The first was an invited talk authored by Kelly and Todd Scanlon, given in a special session on Tree/Grass co-existence convened by Ricardo Holdo. The talk was titled “Transitions between facilitative/competitve eﬀects of tree canopies on herbaceous productivity via impacts on energy/water balance.” 

The second presentation was given by Trenton Franz, with many co-authors; Lizzie King, Alex Lester, myself, Mike Celia, Ignacio Rodriguez-Iturbe, and Dan Rubenstein. Trenton’s talk was titled “Diﬀerences in small-scale water balance by representative hydrologic units of central Kenya.”
