[Cascade Tuholske]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _people/tuholske.md %}), WAVES lab member and PhD student in Geography at UCSB, was named a <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/discoverypark/food/borlaugfellows/" target="_blank"> Borlaug Fellow in Global Food Security </a> to examine urban food security in Accra, Ghana and Lusaka, Zambia. With Sub-Saharan Africa becoming increasingly urban, Cascade's research aims to uncover the underlying processes and determinants of household food security within African cities. In partnership with the International Food Policy Research Institute, he will lead a team of local enumerators to survey households in Accra to understand how food security may relate to income and labor, proximity to markets, and prices. The data collected in Ghana complements a household and market survey recently completed by our colleagues at Indiana University and the Zambia Agriculture Research Institute in Lusaka.
