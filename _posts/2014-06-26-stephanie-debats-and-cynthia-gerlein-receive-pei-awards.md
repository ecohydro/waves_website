[Stephanie]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _people/debats.md %}) got awarded a <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/pei/grads/fellowships-awards/walbridge/" target="_blank">Walbridge Fund Award</a> that will allow her to expand her skill base through workshops and meetings with collaborators in fields such as machine learning, computer vision, and crop modeling. She will also use it to obtain remote sensing imagery as well as develop connections with local agencies in Sub-Saharan Africa to make use of untapped data sources, such as additional crop trials or maps of surveyed farmland. See the PEI announcement <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/pei/news/archive/?id=13123" target="_blank">HERE</a>.

[Cynthia]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _people/gerlein-safdi.md %}) received a <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/pei/grads/step/" target="_blank">PEI-STEP Fellowship</a>. She will be working in collaboration with <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~mauzeral/" target="_blank">Prof. Mauzerall</a> on the influence of policy incentives on the deforestation rate of tropical forests. She will look at decisions taken from the international to the municipal level across three different countries and use the <a href="http://www.earthenginepartners.appspot.com/science-2013-global-forest/download.html" target="_blank">Global Forest Change</a> monitor to look at land use change. Building on her conclusions from those three study cases, she will propose an improved policy framework to protect tropical forests against deforestation.
