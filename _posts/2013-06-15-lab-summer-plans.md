What are the members of the lab up to this summer?

<!--more-->

[Kelly]({{ "/people/caylor" | absolute_url }}) will be doing field work at Mpala during June, attending and presenting at the <a href="http://www2.unibas.it/manfreda/HydroLab/Workshop13.html" target="_blank">2nd International Workshop on Monitoring and Modeling of Hydrological Risk</a> in July, and will be out with Megan Konar at UIUC in August for their Socio-hydrology workshop.

[Frances]({{ "/people/odonnell" | absolute_url }}) Frances moved to Flagstaff, AZ at the end of May and will be settling into her new life and work as a post-doc at the <a href="http://www.research.nau.edu/newsletter/spring2013/post-doc.aspx" target="_blank">Northern Arizona University</a>.

From mid-June to September, [Drew]({{ "/people/gower" | absolute_url }})
 will be out in the field in Kenya, researching the impact of changes in water availability on small-scale agricultural communities in the Laikipia Region.

[Stephanie]({{ "/people/debats" | absolute_url }}) will be out at <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">JPL</a> all summer working in the Computer Vision for Surface Applications group with <a href="http://www.vision.caltech.edu/fuchs/" target="_blank">Thomas Fuchs</a> on mapping agricultural fields in Africa.

[Cynthia]({{ "/people/gerlein-safdi" | absolute_url }}) will be at the <a href="http://stableisotopes.utah.edu/" target="_blank">IsoCamp course in stable isotope in biogeochemistry and ecology</a> in Salt Lake City (UT) for the first two weeks of June. She will then be working at Silas Little Experimental Forest (NJ) to develop a method to analyze in-situ the isotopic content of water from tree stems.

[Adam]({{ "/people/wolf" | absolute_url }}) will be doing some intensive leaf & stem hydraulics measurements at Silas Little Experimental Forest (NJ), with the goal of improving the treatment of drought impacts on forests in global models.

[Lyndon]({{ "/people/estes" | absolute_url }}) will be  developing a paper with Kelly and Tom on community-level crop resilience in relation to different biophysical, social, and management conditions, presenting at the Society for Conservation Biology conference in Baltimore, and supervising two interns on the <a href="http://mappingafrica.princeton.edu" target="_blank">Mapping Africa</a> project and UAV development.
