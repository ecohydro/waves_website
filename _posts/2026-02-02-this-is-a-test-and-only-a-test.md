Thank you for submitting your review manuscript to Earth's Future.  However, Earth's Future has a policy of pre-approval of review articles before manuscript submission. This policy allows our entire board to provide feedback on potential reviews and helps ensure that reviews align with our journal's transdisciplinary focus and meet the needs of our diverse stakeholder community.

To proceed with your review submission, please first submit a 2-page proposal to earthsfuture@agu.org. Your proposal will be evaluated by our Editorial Board based on its alignment with Earth's Future's aims and scope. 

Once your proposal is approved, you will be invited to submit your full manuscript through our submission system.

I have attached our complete Review Article Proposal Guidelines for your reference. Please note that proposals should be submitted directly to the editorial office via email, not through our manuscript submission system.

We recognize this requirement may cause some inconvenience, and we appreciate your understanding as we implement this policy. Your feedback on the process would be valuable as we continue to refine it. We look forward to receiving your review proposal.

You will receive an email with a link to an online survey regarding your experience with the peer review process for this submission. Your comments will help us improve AGU journals and service to authors.

Sincerely,

Kelly Caylor
Editor in Chief
Earth's Future
