  A new article was published by the CaylorLab in <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00344257" target="_blank">Remote Sensing of Environment</a>. <!--more-->In this study, first author [Stephanie Debats]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _people/debats.md %}), along with co-authors Dee Luo, [Lyndon Estes]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _people/estes.md %}) and [Kelly Caylor]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _people/caylor.md %}), propose a new method to identify agricultural fields using remote sensing data and machine learning. In particular, the novel technique is capable of identifying large, commercial-scale fields as well as smallholder fields, giving a unique insight into sub-saharan agricultural patterns. Providing high-resolution maps of agricultural land cover is key to provide a critical and improved constraint for regional crop productivity and to monitor land cover change.
