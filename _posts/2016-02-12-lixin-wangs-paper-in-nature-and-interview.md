<a href="http://caylor.eri.ucsb.edu/portfolio-item/lixin-wang-postdoctoral-research-associate-2009-2011/" target="_blank">Lixin Wang</a>, former member of the EcoHydrology Lab, recently published an article in the journal Nature. <!--more-->The paper looks at how enhanced levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide are a likely key driver of global dryland greening. In some regions, greening could be caused by species change, with greener invasive plants replacing indigenous ones or bushes encroaching on grasslands that are used to graze cattle, Lixin said.
