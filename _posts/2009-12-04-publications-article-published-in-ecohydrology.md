An article examining the impact of infiltration excess flow on models of soil moisture and plant water stress has been published in the journal Ecohydrology

<!--more-->

An article authored by Salvatore Manfreda, Todd Scanlon, and Kelly has just appeared in the journal Ecohydrology. The article explores the effect of neglecting infiltration excess overland flow on simulation of dryland soil moisture dynamics, and the consequences on plant water use and plant water stress. Salvatore shows that in many cases, the nature of rainfall in dryland ecosystems is often intense enough to make characterizing losses caused by maximum soil infiltration capacity important to total water balance. These results emphasize the importance of accurately characterizing both precipitation and infiltration dynamics in drylands when attempting to understand space-time variation in soil moisture.
