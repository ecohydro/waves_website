![Chart Joke]({{ "/assets/uploads/2013/04/shapeimage_1-42.png" | absolute_url }}){: .align-left} The first presentation ever given by one of our group’s students occurred at this fall’s AGU Meeting!


<!--more--> Garth Lindner, a M.S. Student in the Department of Geography at Indiana University gave the following poster presentation in the Hydrology Section. Garth is finishing up his thesis this summer and then heading out to University of Maryland &#8211; Baltimore County to bigger and better things as he joins the NSF IGERT program in Urban Hydrology as a PhD student working with Andy Miller and Claire Welty. It will be nice to have him just down the road (I-95) for the next couple of years.

In addition to Garth’s talk, I also presented some work that Danilo Dragoni and I have been working on at the Morgan Monroe State Forest AmeriFlux site. This research has led to a couple of manuscripts that we are slowly working through review.
