<p>She gave a talk presenting the results of her summer spent at <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">JPL</a>Â in the Computer Vision for Surface Applications group withÂ <a href="http://www.vision.caltech.edu/fuchs/" target="_blank">Thomas Fuchs</a>, developing a machine learning technique toÂ automate Â agricultural fields Â mapping in Africa.Â Here is the summary of her week in the Netherlands:</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.globalfoodsecurityconference.com/" target="_blank">1st Global Food Security Conference</a> was a great opportunity to meet with researchers from a wide variety of fields, who are all interested in food security issues. The participants ranged from hydrologists and ecologists to economists and nutritionists. For me, it was a great opportunity to see the range of questions being asked in the field of food security and also which questions were deemed the most pressing and research-worthy. I got some good insights into experimental design and data analysis techniques. My talk was definitely on the more technology/engineering side of the spectrum of presentations, but it was well received and I identified a couple possible collaborators.</p>
