<p>The article is titled “A Temporally Explicit Production Efficiency Model for Fuel Load Allocation in Southern Africa” and presents a photosynthetic efficiency model applied to southern Africa for the purposes of predicting regional fuel load. A key component of the model is the derivation of a relationship between light use efficiency and prior rainfall, which is developed using a detailed physiological canopy model that includes separate models for C3 woody vegetation and C4 grasses</p>
