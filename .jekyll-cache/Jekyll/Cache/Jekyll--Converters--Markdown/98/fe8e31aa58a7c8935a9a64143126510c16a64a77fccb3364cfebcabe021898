<p>Trenton’s experimental work in collaboration with Rutger’s University has just been accepted in the Vadose Zone Journal. This is Trenton’s second publication from his PhD research (the first can be found here), and the first in a series of papers he is preparing that focus on the use of geophysical methods to reveal subsurface hydrological patterns and process within dryland ecosystems. Additional information on our lab’s geophysical methods in ecohydrology can be found here. The paper will be posted shortly; the Executive Summary is provided below.</p>

<p>Executive Summary</p>

<p>**</p>

<p>Observations from a dryland ecosystem link the distribution of vegetation with patterns of subterranean termite nests. In this laboratory study we present strategies to capture the general behavior of transient soil moisture dynamics generated in macropores. The strategies may help elucidate ecosystem behavior on larger spatial and temporal scales.</p>
