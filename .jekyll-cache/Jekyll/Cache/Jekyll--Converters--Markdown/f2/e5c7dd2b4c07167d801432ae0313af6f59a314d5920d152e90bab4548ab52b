David gave a seminar on his recent research regarding the use of electromagnetic geophysical instruments for conductivity surveys of soil texture, salinity, and water content. David also spent a lot of time with Trenton Franz helping Trenton prepare for his upcoming field work using a DUAL-EM system to map patterns of soil properties at the hillslope scale at his sites in and around the Mpala Research Center in Kenya. We’re extremely glad that David was able to come up and brave our NJ winter and were hoping to get more involved with David and his research in tropical systems… especially visiting him in Trinidad &amp; Tobago sometime soon!</p>
