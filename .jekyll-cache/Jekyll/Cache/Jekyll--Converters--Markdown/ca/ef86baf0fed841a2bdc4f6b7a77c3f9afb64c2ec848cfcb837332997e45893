<p>The workshop was organized by Hans Christian Steen-Larsen and <a href="http://www.lsce.ipsl.fr/Phocea/Pisp/index.php?nom=valerie.masson" target="_blank">Valérie Masson-Delmotte</a> and had been designed to bring together the community involved in measurements and modeling of water vapor stable isotopes in order to review the state of the art, to stimulate new collaborations, and to formulate recommendations for future research. It was decided to write a white paper highlighting the added-value of isotope measurements for atmospheric science studies, the state of the art for each topic, the progress in different research directions allowed by recent water vapor isotopic composition measurements, and key recommendations.</p>
