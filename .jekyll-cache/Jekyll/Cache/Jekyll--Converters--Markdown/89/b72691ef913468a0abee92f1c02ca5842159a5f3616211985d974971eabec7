<p><a href="http://www.ifpri.org/profile/kwaw-andam">Dr. Kwaw Andam</a>, a research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institutes’s (IFPRI) Ghana Strategy Support Program recently visited the WAVES lab and the Department of Geography at UCSB for a week of collaboration. Previously an economist for the World Bank, Dr. Andam’s research focuses on agro-processing, value chain analysis, and livestock production in Ghana. He and <a href="/people/tuholske/">Cascade Tuholske</a> conducted an urban food security survey in Accra in summer 2017 to assess the demographic, socioeconomic, and spatial predictors of household food security in low- and middle-income neighborhoods in Accra, Ghana’s capital. This research is supported by a <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/discoverypark/food/programs/borlaug-fellows/graduate-research-grants.php">Borlaug Fellowship in Global Food Security</a> and IFPRI. While at UCSB, Dr. Andam assisted Cascade with data analysis and drafting of a paper that they plan to publish this spring. While much of his time was spent in the office, Dr. Andam still had time to visit local favorites such as Cold Springs Tavern and the Santa Barbara Harbor.</p>
