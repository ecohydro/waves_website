<a href="/people/debats/">Stephanie</a> got awarded a <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/pei/grads/fellowships-awards/walbridge/" target="_blank">Walbridge Fund Award</a> thatÂ will allow her to expand her skill base through workshops and meetings with collaborators in fields such as machine learning, computer vision, and crop modeling.Â She will also use it to obtain remote sensing imagery as well as develop connections with local agencies in Sub-Saharan Africa to make use of untapped data sources, such as additional crop trials or maps of surveyed farmland. See the PEI announcement <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/pei/news/archive/?id=13123" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</p>

<p><a href="/people/gerlein-safdi/">Cynthia</a> received a <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/pei/grads/step/" target="_blank">PEI-STEP Fellowship</a>. She willÂ be working in collaboration withÂ <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~mauzeral/" target="_blank">Prof. Mauzerall</a>Â on the influence of policy incentives on the deforestation rate of tropical forests. She will look at decisions taken from the international to the municipal level across three different countries and use theÂ <a href="http://www.earthenginepartners.appspot.com/science-2013-global-forest/download.html" target="_blank">Global Forest Change</a>Â monitor to look at land use change. Building on her conclusions from those three study cases, she will propose an improved policy framework to protect tropical forests against deforestation.
