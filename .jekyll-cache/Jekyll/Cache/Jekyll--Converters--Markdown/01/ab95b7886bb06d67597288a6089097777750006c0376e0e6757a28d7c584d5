Lixin is the lead author, along with Kelly and Danilo Dragoni, who is our collaborator at the Morgan-Monroe State Forest site at Indiana University.</p>

<p>The manuscript presents a new method for calibration of the WVIA using a dew point generator to create a vapor source of known isotopic composition from a liquid isotope standard. The manuscript should appear in an upcoming issue in the next few weeks.</p>
