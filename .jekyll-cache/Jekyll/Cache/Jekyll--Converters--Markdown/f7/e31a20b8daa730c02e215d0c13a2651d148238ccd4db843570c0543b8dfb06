<p>What are the members of the lab up to this summer?</p>

<!--more-->

<p><a href="/people/caylor/">Kelly</a> will be doing field work at Mpala during June, attending and presenting at the <a href="http://www2.unibas.it/manfreda/HydroLab/Workshop13.html" target="_blank">2nd International Workshop on Monitoring and Modeling of Hydrological Risk</a> in July, and will be out with Megan Konar at UIUC in August for their Socio-hydrology workshop.</p>

<p><a href="/people/fodonnell/">Frances</a> Frances moved to Flagstaff, AZ at the end of May and will be settling into her new life and work as a post-doc at the <a href="http://www.research.nau.edu/newsletter/spring2013/post-doc.aspx" target="_blank">Northern Arizona University</a>.</p>

<p>From mid-June to September, <a href="/people/gower/">Drew</a>
 will be out in the field in Kenya, researching the impact of changes in water availability on small-scale agricultural communities in the Laikipia Region.</p>

<p><a href="/people/debats/">Stephanie</a> will be out at <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">JPL</a> all summer working in the Computer Vision for Surface Applications group with <a href="http://www.vision.caltech.edu/fuchs/" target="_blank">Thomas Fuchs</a> on mapping agricultural fields in Africa.</p>

<p><a href="/people/gerlein-safdi/">Cynthia</a> will be at the <a href="http://stableisotopes.utah.edu/" target="_blank">IsoCamp course in stable isotope in biogeochemistry and ecology</a> in Salt Lake City (UT) for the first two weeks of June. She will then be working at Silas Little Experimental Forest (NJ) to develop a method to analyze in-situ the isotopic content of water from tree stems.</p>

<p><a href="/people/wolf/">Adam</a> will be doing some intensive leaf &amp; stem hydraulics measurements at Silas Little Experimental Forest (NJ), with the goal of improving the treatment of drought impacts on forests in global models.</p>

<p><a href="/people/estes/">Lyndon</a> will be  developing a paper with Kelly and Tom on community-level crop resilience in relation to different biophysical, social, and management conditions, presenting at the Society for Conservation Biology conference in Baltimore, and supervising two interns on the <a href="http://mappingafrica.princeton.edu" target="_blank">Mapping Africa</a> project and UAV development.</p>
