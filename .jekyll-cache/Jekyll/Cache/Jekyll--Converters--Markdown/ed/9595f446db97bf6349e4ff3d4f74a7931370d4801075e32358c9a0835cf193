<p>Introduction to the principles of environmental observation and the application of environmental physics to understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics of water and energy flows within local Californian ecosystems. Field work completed during break between winter and spring quarters.</p>

<h3 id="course-summary">Course Summary</h3>

<p>This week-long intensive course, offered during the UC-system spring break, will provide an introduction to the principles of environmental physics and their application to ecological sciences, with a focus on combined instrumentation methods and analytical approaches for characterizing the spatial and temporal patterns of water and energy flows through Califor- nia ecosystems. Lectures and field activities will address the theory of operation, design, and implementation of methods used to quantify patterns and processes of energy and water with particular emphasis on characterizing the biological signature and ecological impact of coupled landscape ecological/hydrological dynamics. Course observations will be integrated with hydrological theory and modeling approaches in order to understand how water/energy balance is partitioned at the land surface and mechanisms that control hydrological dy- namics across scales from points to landscapes. Emphasis will be placed on applications of hydrological science and environmental biophysics to issues of sustainable landscape use, water resource conservation, preservation of biodiversity, and prevention/reversal of land degradation in dryland ecosystems.</p>

<h3 id="course-goals">Course Goals</h3>

<ol>
  <li>To form a quantitative understanding of environmental physics and its use in pre- dicting both physical/ecological constraints on patterns and processes related to the distribution and flows of energy, water, and carbon within ecosystems.</li>
  <li>To understand the theory behind environmental measurement techniques and their application to evaluate components of water and energy balance across a range of physical (point to landscape) and ecological (leaf to ecosystem) scales</li>
  <li>To integrate theory and observations of hydrological and physical science to address fundamental questions regarding plant water use, ecosystem structure and function, and the patterns of water and energy flows in dryland ecosystems.</li>
