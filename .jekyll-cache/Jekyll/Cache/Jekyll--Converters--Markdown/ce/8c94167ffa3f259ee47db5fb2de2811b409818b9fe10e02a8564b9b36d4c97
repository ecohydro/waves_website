<p><a href="/people/wolf/">Adam Wolf</a> from the Caylor Lab, along with researchers at Princeton University and other institutions, just published <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/349/6247/528" target="_blank">a new article in Science</a>. <!--more-->In this paper, the authors studied a tree-ring database of 1338 forest sites from around the globe. They found that forests exhibit a drought “legacy effect” with 3 to 4 years’ reduced growth following drought. During this postdrought delay, forests will be less able to act as a sink for carbon. Incorporating forest legacy effects into Earth system models will provide more accurate predictions of the effects of drought on the global carbon cycle.</p>
