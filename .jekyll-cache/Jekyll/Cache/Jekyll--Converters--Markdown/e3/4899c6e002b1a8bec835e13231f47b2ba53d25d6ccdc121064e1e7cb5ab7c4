I"<p><a href="/people/avery/">Ryan Avery</a> Ryan taught a coding workshop at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, VA October 25-26. It was a fast-paced, two-day workshop that was well attended by undergraduates, graduate students, faculty, and local computing staff. Ryan taught parts of the session covering the Unix Shell, Github, and R, while his co-instructor, Josh Quan, taught R and Rstudio. Towards the end, learners had the chance to make publication quality plots with ggplot and share code projects on github. The workshop was funded by the South Big Data Innovation Hub’s DataUp program, a consortium of universities, foundations, corporations, and cities focused on buidling capacity in data science.
