I"!<p>Jimmy is a rising senior at <a href="http://www.lawrenceville.org/" target="_blank">The Lawrenceville School</a> and worked in our lab during the summer of 2014 through the Hutchins Scholars program. He worked with <a href="http://caylor.eri.ucsb.edu/portfolio-item/elliot-chang-undergraduate-student-isotope-hydrology/" target="_blank">Elliot</a> on testing the use of alginate and chitosan beads for organics removal in plant water samples.Â Jimmy was also in charge of collecting and processing the samples for the water theft project at Silas Little Experimental Forest. And when he was not busy with those two projects, he even found the time to learn how to use an Arduino and might soon be the latest recruit of the <a href="http://pulselab.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">PulseLab</a>.</p>
