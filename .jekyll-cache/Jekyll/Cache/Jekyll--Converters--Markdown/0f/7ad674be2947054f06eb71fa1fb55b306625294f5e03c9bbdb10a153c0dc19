I"ð<p>Last week <a href="/people/estes/">Lyndon Estes</a> and <a href="/people/caylor/">Kelly Caylor</a> were in Italy to help teach a new course on UAS for Environmental Monitoring.<!--more--> The course was organized by Kelly andÂ <a href="http://www2.unibas.it/manfreda/HydroLab/home.html" target="_blank">Salvatore Manfreda</a>, and run under the aegis of the University of Basilicata. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jorge_Gago2" target="_blank">Xurxo Gago</a> from the Universitat de les Illes Balears provided instruction on multicopters and estimating crop water use from thermal imagery. The classes were held in the ancient city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matera" target="_blank">Matera</a>, while flight training and data collection practicals took place in farmland to the south near Metaponto.<!--more--></p>

<p>By the end of the week, 17 students successfully ran a data collection mission (using fixed-wing UAS fromÂ <a href="http://readytodrone.com/">readytodrone.com</a>), processed the resulting imagery into orthomosaics and DEMs, and did some initial data analysis, including a comparison of leaf area index measurements made in the field, UAS-derived BNDVI, and Landsat-derived NDVI (Marc Mayes from Brown University found that Landsat 8 had imaged the area during that week, making a very nice comparison). The student presentations and lectures are available <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Summer_School_of_Hydrology" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>TheyÂ hope to run this course again next summer, so please watch <a href="http://lyndonestes.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Lyndonâ€™s website</a>Â if you are interested in learning how to use UAS toÂ close the gap between field and spaceborne observations.</p>
