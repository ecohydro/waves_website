<p><a href="/people/caylor/">Kelly Caylor</a> and a group of scientists from Princeton University recently published a <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/347/6222/651.full" target="_blank">paper</a> in <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/" target="_blank">Science</a> on the influence of termite mounds in dryland ecosystems. <!--more-->Spotty vegetation patterns in tropical savannas and grasslands can be a warning sign of imminent desertification. However, the groupÂ finds that termites can also produce spotty patterns. Their theoretical study, confirmed by field data from Kenya, shows that patterns produced by termite mounds are not harbingers of desertification. Indeed, the presence of termites buffers these ecosystems against climate change.</p>
