    Guiomar joined the Caylor lab from September to December 2015. She implemented a parsimonious eco-hydrological model of the Upper Ewaso river basin using only NDVI data as observations. Currently, hydrological model evaluations remain focused on comparing simulations to a single spatially aggregated catchment scale observation in the form of river discharge. This notion is outdated and limits the use of the models. Therefore, a paradigm shift it required, moving away from the aggregated evaluation of hydrological models towards a spatially distributed approach. </p>
<p><span class="s1">Her research interest is focused on the ability of models to reproduce observed temporal and spatial patterns. She is currently finishing her PhD in the Water and Environmental Engineering program at the <a href="http://lluvia.dihma.upv.es/index_es.html" target="_blank">Research Institute of Water Engineering and Environment (IIAMA) </a>of the Universitat Politècnica de València (Spain), under the supervision of Prof. Félix Francés.</span></p>
