I"½<p>Summary of how seasonal average growth rate (E(r), contour lines) varies according to maximum plant growth rate (rmax) and rainfall frequency (p). In this plot the value of Î²dtol is taken to = 2. For all possible rainfall rates, maximum seasonal average growth rates occur when rmax is less than 1, demonstrating the importance of drought tolerance selection when attempting to maximize cultivar growth rate in a stochastic environment.</p>
