<p>Soil 15 N is a natural tracer of nitrogenÂ (N) cycling. Its spatial distribution is a good indicatorÂ of processes that are critical to N cycling and of theirÂ controlling factors integrated both in time and space.Â The spatial distribution of soil <strong>d</strong>15 N and its underlyingÂ drivers at sub-kilometer scales are rarely investigated.Â This study utilizes two sites (dry vs. wet) from aÂ megatransect in southern Africa encompassing locationsÂ with similar soil substrate but different rainfallÂ and vegetation, to explore the effects of soil moistureÂ and vegetation distribution on ecosystem-scaleÂ patterns of soil <strong>d</strong>15 N. A 300-m long transect was setÂ up at each site and surface soil samples were randomlycollected for analyses of <strong>d</strong>15 N,%N and nitrate content.Â At each soil sampling location the presence of grasses,Â woody plants, AcaciaÂ  species (potential N fixer) asÂ well as soil moisture levels were recorded. A spatialÂ pattern of soil <strong>d</strong>15 N existed at the dry site, but not at theÂ wet site. Woody cover distribution determined the soilÂ <strong>d</strong>15 N spatial pattern at ecosystem-scale; however, theÂ two AcaciaÂ  species did not contribute to the spatialÂ pattern of soil <strong>d</strong>15 N. Grass cover was negativelyÂ correlated with soil <strong>d</strong>15 N at both sites owing to theÂ lower foliar <strong>d</strong>15 N values of grasses. Soil moisture didÂ not play a role in the spatial pattern of soil <strong>d</strong>15 N atÂ either site. These results suggest that vegetationÂ distribution, directly, and water availability, indirectly,Â affect the spatial patterns of soil <strong>d</strong>15 N throughÂ their effects on woody plant and grass distributions.</p>
