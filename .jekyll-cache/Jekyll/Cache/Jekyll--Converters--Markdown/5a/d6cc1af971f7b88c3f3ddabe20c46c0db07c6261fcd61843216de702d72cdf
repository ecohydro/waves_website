<p>The article is ‚ÄúCharacterizing ecohydrological and biogeochemical connectivity across multiple scales: a new conceptual framework.‚Äù It explores the use of simple methods designed for simplifying and embedding hierarchically-organized electrical circuits as a means to handle spatial scaling of complex ecohydrological processes related to carbon, water, and nutrient cycling. As our lab‚Äôs first ‚Äúgroup paper‚Äù, we feel it is certainly one of the crazier manuscripts we‚Äôve ever put together! Additional co-authors include conference participants Chris Zou, Gretchen R. Milller, Jessica M. Cable, and Barbara Bond.</p>

<p>The article will appear as part of a Special Issue based on the 2009 AGU Chapman Conference, so it may be quite some time before it appears in print.</p>

<p>Update: The article is now available</p>
