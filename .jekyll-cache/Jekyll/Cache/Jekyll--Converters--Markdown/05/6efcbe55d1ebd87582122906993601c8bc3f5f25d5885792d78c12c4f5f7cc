<p>Evapotranspiration (ET) is an important component of the global hydrological cycle. However, toÂ what extent transpiration ratios (T/ET) are controlled by vegetation and the mechanisms of global-scaleÂ T/ET variations are not clear. We synthesized all the published papers that measured at least two ofÂ the three components (E, T, and ET) and leaf area index (LAI) simultaneously. Nonlinear relationshipsÂ between T/ET and LAI were identified for both the overall data set and agricultural or natural dataÂ subsets. Large variations in T/ET occurred across all LAI ranges with wider variability at lower LAI. ForÂ a given LAI, higher T/ET was observed during later vegetation growing stage within a season. WeÂ developed a function relating T/ET to the growing stage relative to the timing of peak LAI. LAI andÂ growing stage collectively explained 43% of the variations in the global T/ET data set, providing a newÂ way to interpret and model global T/ET variability.</p>
