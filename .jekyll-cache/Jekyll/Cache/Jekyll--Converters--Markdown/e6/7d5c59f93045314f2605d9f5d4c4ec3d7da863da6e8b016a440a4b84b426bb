<p><a href="/people/estes/">Lyndon</a> and <a href="/people/caylor/">Kelly</a> recently came back fromÂ San Jose, where they attended the AAAS 2015 Annual Meeting to convene a session on â€œ<a href="https://aaas.confex.com/aaas/2015/webprogram/Session9691.html">Advances in Earth Observation: Enabling New Insights into Global Environmental Change</a>â€œ.<!--more--> The session featured <a href="http://geog.umd.edu/facultyprofile/Hansen/Matthew%20C.">Matt Hansen</a>Â and <a href="http://kellylab.berkeley.edu/">Maggi Kelly</a>. The goal of the session was to illustrate how new methods and hardware, such as advanced parallel processing, in-field environmental sensors, and data integration platforms, are starting to fill in the spatial and temporal gaps in our current abilities to observe ecological processes. TheyÂ had a pretty nice turnout, despite the fact that they were scheduled for 8 am on Sunday morning!</p>
