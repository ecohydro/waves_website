<p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Throughout his undergraduate education, Elliot has persisted in studying removal methods of volatile organic compounds that cause spectral interference in isotope ratio infrared spectrometry measurements of plant/soil waters. Supported by <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/pei/undergrads/pei-environmental-scholar/" target="_blank">Princeton Environmental Institute’s Smith-Newton Scholarship </a>(2014), he has collaborated with Picarro Inc. (Sunnyvale, CA), Center for Stable Isotope Biogeochemistry (Berkeley, CA), and Princeton NMR Facilities (Princeton, NJ) in reaching his current solution. Elliot’s final work was <a href="http://caylor.eri.ucsb.edu/2016/02/elliot-changs-1st-paper-featured-on-the-cee-website/" target="_blank">published in RCMS in January 2016</a>, and the developed purification protocol is patent pending.</span>

  Elliot started his PhD at UC Berkeley in the Fall 2016, under <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/~lnlammers/index.html" target="_blank">Pr. Laura Lammers</a>.
</p>
<p class="p1">
<span class="s1">When he is not working, Elliot is a concert composer. His most recent commissions include an orchestral work premiere by the Sinfonia Orchestra in Richardson Auditorium and a string orchestra piece to be premiered by the United Nations International School at Carnegie Hall in 2016.</span>
