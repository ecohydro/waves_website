During his time in the Peace Corps, Stephen worked with a group of small communities to plan, finance, design, construct, and maintain rural water systems. He helped to install 13 km of hand dug trenches, built a 50,000 gallon storage tank, and connected about 200 families to a community water system. Weâ€™ve included a few photos of his work in the Dominican Republic, and are excited to have Stephen here at Princeton.</p>
