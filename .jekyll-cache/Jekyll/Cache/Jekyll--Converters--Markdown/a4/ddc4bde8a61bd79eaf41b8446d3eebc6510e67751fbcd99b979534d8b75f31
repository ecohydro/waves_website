<p>We recently published a <a href="http://www.biogeosciences.net/11/6939/2014/bg-11-6939-2014.html" target="_blank">paper</a> in <a href="http://www.biogeosciences.net/index.html" target="_blank">Biogeosciences</a>.<!--more-->In the research article, we generate different rainfall scenarios with fixed total annual rainfall but shifts in (i) frequency vs. intensity, (ii) rainy season length vs. frequency, (iii) intensity vs. rainy season length. These scenarios are fed into SEIB-DGVM to investigate changes in biome distributions and ecosystem productivity. We find a loss of ecosystem productivity with increased rainfall frequency and decreased intensity at very low rainfall regimes (&lt;400 mm year<sup>âˆ’1</sup>) and low frequency (&lt;0.3 event day<sup>âˆ’1</sup>); beyond these very dry regimes, most ecosystems benefit from increased frequency and decreased intensity, except in the wet tropics (&gt;1800 mm year<sup>âˆ’1</sup>) where radiation limitation prevents further productivity gains.</p>
