The position is a joint appointment with the Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources. Although weâ€™re sad to see her leave Princeton, weâ€™re thrilled that sheâ€™s found a position that fits her interests so well. Weâ€™ll be saying our farewells to Lizzie early next year, but for now weâ€™re happy to say:</p>
