<p>An article authored by Lixin Wang has just appeared in the journal Plant and Soil. This research sought to test assumptions about nitrogen limitation on grass production across a series of sites in the Kalahari Desert of Botswana. Lixin’s work showed that although additional nitrogen and phosphorus were taken up by grass species at all sites, these additions did not change the amount of N in grass tissue. Furthermore, the effect of rainfall dominated overall productivity even in the sites that were climatically “wettest”, and therefore most expected to be nutrient limited.</p>
