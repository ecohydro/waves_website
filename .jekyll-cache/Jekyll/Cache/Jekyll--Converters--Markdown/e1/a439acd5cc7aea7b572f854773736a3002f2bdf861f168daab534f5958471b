The program engages faculty from disparate disciplines with postdoctoral fellows and students at all levels of the Princeton University community to examine the scientific, technological, policy and human dimensions of pressing environmental issues.</p>

<p>Our group‚Äôs research forms one component of the ‚ÄúDevelopment‚Äù challenge, which connects biodiversity conservation and sustainable resource management with a mission to improve human livelihoods. Nowhere is the challenge greater than in Africa where development has been erratic, tempered by corruption, lacking in true capacity building, and pursued without concern for preserving the continent‚Äôs wildlife and store of natural resources.</p>

<p>Development Challenge <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/grandchallenges/development/research-highlights/">research projects</a> include several continuing projects that identify water as the essential natural resource shaping the African landscape. Working side by side in the field, teams of Princeton ecologists, anthropologists and hydrologists document the linkages between water, wildlife and human populations in East African dry lands and contribute scholarship concerning the role of vegetation in the hydrological cycle and in the preservation of landscapes and wildlife habitats</p>
