<p>The regional distribution of woody vegetation is influenced by the complex interactions between the climate, soil, and vegetation. Combining an existing soil water balance model and a resource trade-off hypothesis we present a framework and solution to the constrained optimization problem for a dryland ecosystem in central Kenya. Using the parsimonious framework we test the influences of changes to total rainfall and/or inter-annual rainfall variability on the spatial composition of three Acacia species in the dryland ecosystem.</p>
