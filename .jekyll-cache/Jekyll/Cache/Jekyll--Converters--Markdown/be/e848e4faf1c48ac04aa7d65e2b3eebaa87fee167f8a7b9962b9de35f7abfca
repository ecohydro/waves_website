<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:
The isotopic composition of water vapour provides integrated perspectives on the hydrological histories of air masses and has been widely used for tracing physical processes in hydrological and climatic studies. Over the last two decades, the infrared laser spectroscopy technique has been used to measure the isotopic composition of water vapour near the Earth‚Äôs surface. Here, we have assembled a global database of high temporal resolution stable water vapour isotope ratios (Œ¥18O and Œ¥D) observed using this measurement technique. As of March 2018, the database includes data collected at 35 sites in 15 K√∂ppen climate zones from the years 2004 to 2017. The key variables in each dataset are hourly values of Œ¥18O and Œ¥D in atmospheric water vapour. To support interpretation of the isotopologue data, synchronized time series of standard meteorological variables from in situ observations and ERA5 reanalyses are also provided. This database is intended to serve as a centralized platform allowing researchers to share their vapour isotope datasets, thus facilitating investigations that transcend disciplinary and geographic boundaries.</p>
