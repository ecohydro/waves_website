<p>The article uses stable isotopes of carbon to examine sources of soil carbon within soils located at two ends of a rainfall gradient in western Botswana. The results demonstrate clear shifts in the contribution of trees/grasses to total soil carbon as well as much greater levels of spatial heterogeneity in both sources and amounts of carbon at the drier site.
