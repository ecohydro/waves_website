<p>April showers brings summer funding for WAVES lab students!</p>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _people/tuholske.md %}">Cascade Tuholske</a> was awarded the <a href="https://www.graddiv.ucsb.edu/financial/central-campus-fellowships" target="_blank">President's Dissertation Year Fellowship</a> at UCSB. The award enables students to delve fully into their dissertation and aims to increase the number of students who contribute to UCSB's diversity. Cascade will use this opportunity to continue his research focused on the relationship between urban population dynamics, climate change, and urban food security across Africa. Stay tuned, as he expects to have new publication demonstrating a novel method to measure urban population distributions in Africa out this summer.</p>
<p>To support her work studying the coupled dynamics of smallholder farming systems and climate variability in east Africa, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _people/krell.md %}">Natasha Krell</a> was awarded a Schmidt Environmental Solutions Award funded by <a href="http://tsffoundation.org" target="_blank">The Schmidt Family Foundation</a>. The award will support her dissertation work and science communication efforts. UCSB's group of inaugural Schmidt Environmental Solutions Fellows were recently featured in the <a href="https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2019/019464/sense-urgency" target="_blank">UCSB current</a>. She was also awarded a Department of Defense <a href="https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2019/019464/sense-urgency" target="_blank">Science, Mathematics, and Research for Transformation</a> scholarship which will provide two years of support for her dissertation.</p>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _people/avery.md %}">Ryan Avery</a> &amp; Bryn Morgan were awarded the high honor of Honorable Mention for the prestigious  <a href="https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2019/019464/sense-urgency" target="_blank">National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program</a>. Bryn was also selected as a semi-finalist for the <a href="https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2019/019464/sense-urgency" target="_blank">Fulbright Student Program</a> to Namibia.</p>
<p>Congrats everyone!</p>
