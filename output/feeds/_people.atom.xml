&lt;p&gt;Cynthia first joined the Caylor Lab in Spring 2011 and spent six months applying geophysical methods (ground penetrating radar and electromagnetic induction) to solve environmental questions. After a few months spent in Chile, she came back to the Caylor Lab and started her PhD in September, 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She spent her first summer doing fieldwork at Silas Little Experimental Forest (NJ) with Adam, studying plant hydraulics and water theft between trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After passing her General Exams in May 2014, she started working on her thesis project looking at the influence of non-meteoric water deposition on the water status of Colocasia esculenta leaves using stable isotopes as tracers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 2014, Cynthia got awarded a NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship. In June 2014, she received a PEI-STEP Fellowship to spend part of PhD working on an aspect of environmental policy. The picture above was taken in Kenya and shows John teaching Cynthia how to use an augur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2015 to 2017, Cynthia was an Exchange Scholar at Harvard University, working in Pr. N.M. Holbrook’s lab in the department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cynthia is currently at the University of Michigan, where she is a Michigan Society of Fellows postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Climate and Space Sciences and Engineering, College of Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="_people"></category></entry><entry><title>Marc Mayes, Nature Conservancy NatureNet Fellow</title><link href="/marc-mayes-nature-conservancy-naturenet-fellow.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-11-20T17:36:58+00:00</published><updated>2016-11-20T17:36:58+00:00</updated><author><name>Marc Mayes</name></author><id>tag:None,2016-11-20:/marc-mayes-nature-conservancy-naturenet-fellow.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Marc is a self-described “humanistic remote sensing biogeochemist.” He studies how climate and land cover changes affect ecosystem carbon, water and nutrient cycles at landscape scales, and subsequent impacts for the availability of natural resources people need, such as water and wood-derived energy.

As part of this work, Marc develops and improves upon methods of scaling field data on land cover, vegetation structure and function to remotely sensed data, including data from satellites and UAVs (drones). Marc has been involved with paleoclimate, limnology, forestry and soil biogeochemistry fieldwork on land and large lakes in east and southern Africa (Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, Zambia) since 2007. He is committed to a career that involves building scientific capacity in southern Africa and other developing communities worldwide, and connecting ecosystem science to conservation-development needs. Marc recently completed his PhD in the Brown Geological Sciences-Marine Biological Lab Joint Program, with a thesis addressing biogeochemistry and satellite monitoring of regrowing Miombo Woodlands in western Tanzania. He joined theCaylor Lab in September 2016 as a Nature Conservancy NatureNet Science Postdoctoral Fellow, working with Dr. Anne Trainor, who works with TNC’s Africa Program, and within the Caylorverse, Kelly, Lyndon and colleagues at Princeton (Dan Rubenstein) on projects in Zambia and Kenya. Marc is based between Princeton Environment Institute and the Earth Research Institute at UC-Santa Barbara. Off the clock, Marc is a triathlete, kayaker, cross-country skier and general lover of the outdoors. Marc is also a musician, a pianist and saxophonist who has a record as an instigator and long-time participant of the (in) famous largest all-saxophone ensemble in New England, The Saxyderms.

&lt;p&gt;Stephen spent two years prior to coming to Princeton in the Peace Corps, working in the Dominican Republic. Living on $1000 a year prepared him well for graduate work. That and his 2 degrees in Engineering, plus the fact that he can read C code the way the pope reads Latin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen's PhD focused on how water (and/or the lack thereof) interacts with ecosystems and environments, from canopy to continent scale. His main emphasis was on the use of isotopic tracers to partition water vapor fluxes in dryland ecosystems. Stephen received his PhD in 2013. After a postdoc at the University of Utah working with &lt;a href="http://wateriso.utah.edu/spatial/index.html"&gt;Gabe Bowen&lt;/a&gt;, he is now an &lt;a href="http://bee.oregonstate.edu/stephen-good"&gt;assistant professor at Oregon State University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="_people"></category></entry><entry><title>Jeremy Chen, PEI Grand Challenges Intern (2010)</title><link href="/jeremy-chen-pei-grand-challenges-intern-2010.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-03-21T14:28:25+00:00</published><updated>2010-03-21T14:28:25+00:00</updated><author><name>Jeremy Chen</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-03-21:/jeremy-chen-pei-grand-challenges-intern-2010.html</id><content type="html">&lt;ul&gt;
