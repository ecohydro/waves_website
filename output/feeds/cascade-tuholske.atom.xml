&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;:Increased exposure to extreme heat from both climate change and the urban heat island effect—total urban warming—threatens the sustainability of rapidly growing urban settlements worldwide.
Extreme heat exposure is highly unequal and severely impacts the urban poor. While previous studies have quantified global exposure to extreme heat, the lack of a globally accurate, fine-resolution
temporal analysis of urban exposure crucially limits our ability to deploy adaptations. Here, we estimate daily urban population exposure to extreme heat for 13,115 urban settlements from 1983 to 2016. We
harmonize global, fine-resolution (0.05°), daily temperature maxima and relative humidity estimates with geolocated and longitudinal global urban population data. We measure the average annual rate of
increase in exposure (person-days/year−1) at the global, regional, national, and municipality levels, separating the contribution to exposure trajectories from urban population growth versus total urban
warming. Using a daily maximum wet bulb globe temperature threshold of 30 °C, global exposure increased nearly 200% from 1983 to 2016. Total urban warming elevated the annual increase in exposure by 52%
compared to urban population growth alone. Exposure trajectories increased for 46% of urban settlements, which together in 2016 comprised 23% of the planet’s population (1.7 billion people). However, how
total urban warming and pop- ulation growth drove exposure trajectories is spatially heterogeneous. This study reinforces the importance of employing multiple extreme heat exposure metrics to identify
local patterns and compare exposure trends across geographies. Our results suggest that previous research underestimates extreme heat exposure, highlighting the urgency for targeted adaptations and early
warning systems to reduce harm from urban extreme heat exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;:The urban population in Sub-Saharan Africa is projected to expand by nearly 800 million people in the next 30 years. How this rapid urban transition is affecting household-level urban food security, and reverberating into broader food systems, is poorly understood. To fill this gap, we use data from a 2017 survey (n = 668) of low- and middle-income residents of Accra, Ghana, to characterize and compare the predictors of household-level food security using three established metrics: the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS); the Household Food Insecurity Access Prevalence (HFIAP); and the Food Consumption Score (FCS). According to HFIAP, 70% of sampled households are food insecure, but only 2% fall below acceptable thresholds measured by FCS. Only one household reported sourcing food from modern supermarkets and fewer than 3% produce food for consumption through gardening, farming, or fishing. Instead, households rely on purchased food from traditional markets, local stalls and kiosks, and street hawkers. Results from a suite of general linear models show that household assets, education, and demographic characteristics are significantly associated with food security outcomes according to HFIAS and HFIAP. The poor correlation and weak model agreement between dietary recall such as FCS, and experience-based food security metrics, like HFIAS and HFIAP, highlight limitations of employing historically rural-centric food security measurement approaches within the urban context. Given that Sub-Saharan Africa’s future is urban, our results add empirical evidence in support of the growing chorus of scholars advocating for comprehensive urban-oriented food security research and policy agendas across Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;: African cities face immense challenges over the coming decades. As countries urbanize, African cities must maintain service provision for rapidly increasing populations, yet with limited resources. In particular, urban food systems must be able to cope with regional food shortages and catalyze (or at least enable) the distribution of food from diverse sources in order to ensure that the cost of food remains affordable for all of the segments of a city’s population. Food systems in most African cities are composed of wholesale sellers, formal markets, street vendors, shops, and increasingly large-scale international stores, creating an evolving landscape of food sources. At the same time, urban population growth can result in rapid changes in urban structure with new peri-urban development and transitions in socioeconomic status within existing areas. Governance plays an important role in the creation and coordination of formal and informal actors across different types of food providers. At the municipal level, new markets must be approved to keep pace with urban expansion. Within residential areas, market management committees must work to maintain traditional markets in the context of increasing competition from large-scale grocers and small-scale street vendors. We use household and market-level data that was collected in Lusaka, Zambia, to conduct an institutional analysis of residential areas to examine the interplay between households, public markets, and street vendors. Analysis of the city’s food system identifies a complex network of relationships featuring formal and informal governance arrangements, which may affect food system functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;: Africa is projected to add one billion urban residents by 2050. Yet developing sustainable solutions to tackle the host of challenges posed by rapid urban population growth is stymied by a lack municipality-level population data across the continent. To fill this gap, we intersect volunteered urban settlement data from OpenStreetMap with five synthetic gridded population datasets to estimate the how Africa’s urban population is distributed among over 4750 individual urban
settlements across Africa. We assess how urban settlement distributions changed from 2000 to 2015
within and between countries and across moisture zones. To this end, we construct urban settlement
Lorenz curves to calculate change in Gini coefficients and test the degree to which Africa’s urban
settlements distributions fit power law distributions exhibited by Zipf’s law. Our results reveal that
77%–85% of urban settlements in Africa have fewer than 100 000 people and that at least 50% of
Africa’s urban population live in urban settlements with fewer than 1 million residents. Across almost
all African countries, the distribution of urban population shifted towards larger cities between 2000
and 2015. However, in arid regions, our results indicate that small- and medium-sized urban
settlements are absorbing a greater share of urban population growth compared to large urban settlements. While our urban population estimates vary across gridded population datasets and differ
from United Nations estimates, this is the first paper to measure urban population across Africa using
a consistent methodology to identify urban settlement populations. Unlike UN urban population data
for Africa, our results can readily be incorporated with geolocated environmental, public health, and
economic data to support efforts to monitor United Nations Sustainable Development Goals related
to urban sustainability, poverty reduction, and food security across Africa’s ever-growing urban
settlements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;: Few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of Zika virus (ZIKV) public health educational campaigns. Following a ZIKV educational campaign in Roatán, Honduras (October 2016), a survey was administered (March–May 2017) to residents (N = 348) and health-care professionals ([HCPs]; N = 44) to evaluate ZIKV knowledge, attitudes, and preventive practices, with attention to sexual health. Knowledge scores were calculated and mapped using participants’ home locations. The knowledge scores between HCPs and residents were significantly different (mean 17 versus 11; P &amp;lt; 0.001). Only 6% of residents and 14% of HCPs knew that ZIKV was sexually transmissible. Few reported abstinence (2.6% residents; 9.4% HCPs) or condom use (1.6% residents; 12.5% HCPs) to prevent ZIKV infection. Of all subjects, 15.6% were pregnant or had a pregnant partner in the past year; 57.6% expressed concern over ZIKV. Mapping demonstrated spatial heterogeneity in knowledge. The findings suggest a need for improved public health messaging in ZIKV-affected areas.&lt;/p&gt;

Previously an economist for the World Bank, Dr. Andam's research focuses on agro-processing, value chain analysis, and livestock production in Ghana. He and &lt;a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _people/tuholske.md %}"&gt;Cascade Tuholske&lt;/a&gt; conducted an urban food security survey in Accra in summer 2017 to assess the demographic, socioeconomic, and spatial predictors of household food security in low- and middle-income neighborhoods in Accra, Ghana's capital. This research is supported by a &lt;a href="https://www.purdue.edu/discoverypark/food/programs/borlaug-fellows/graduate-research-grants.php"&gt;Borlaug Fellowship in Global Food Security&lt;/a&gt; and IFPRI. While at UCSB, Dr. Andam assisted Cascade with data analysis and drafting of a paper that they plan to publish this spring. While much of his time was spent in the office, Dr. Andam still had time to visit local favorites such as Cold Springs Tavern and the Santa Barbara Harbor.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="_posts"></category></entry><entry><title>WAVES Lab Contributes to 2017 FAO State of Food &amp; Agriculture Report</title><link href="/waves-lab-contributes-to-2017-fao-state-of-food-agriculture-report.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-10-10T16:01:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-10-10T16:01:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Cascade Tuholske</name></author><id>tag:None,2017-10-10:/waves-lab-contributes-to-2017-fao-state-of-food-agriculture-report.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) released its flagship report &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/state-of-food-agriculture/en/"&gt;2017 The State of Food and Agriculture: Leveraging Food Systems for Inclusive Rural Transformation&lt;/a&gt; last week. Focused on strengthening rural livelihoods through rural-urban linkages, the report outlines the challenges and opportunities for food systems in rapidly urbanizing low- and lower-middle-income countries. &lt;a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _people/tuholske.md %}"&gt;Cascade Tuholske&lt;/a&gt;, WAVES lab member and PhD student in Geography at UCSB, had the fortune to contribute to sections on urbanization and urban food systems. Rural communities may benefit from urbanization as urban consumer demand for food increases. However, urbanization can also lead to neglect of rural communities. To capitalize on urbanization to grow rural economies, the report encourages policymakers to develop inclusive and integrative strategies that specifically link rural economies and food systems with neighboring small towns and cities. Through such policies, countries can work toward achieving &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/sustainable-development-goals/goals/goal-2/en/"&gt;zero hunger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/sustainable-development-goals/goals/goal-1/en/"&gt;zero poverty&lt;/a&gt; by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="_posts"></category></entry><entry><title>Thirty years of land use/cover change in the Caribbean: Assessing the relationship between urbanization and mangrove loss in Roatán, Honduras</title><link href="/thirty-years-of-land-usecover-change-in-the-caribbean-assessing-the-relationship-between-urbanization-and-mangrove-loss-in-roatan-honduras.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-08-29T17:32:15+00:00</published><updated>2017-08-29T17:32:15+00:00</updated><author><name>Cascade Tuholske</name></author><id>tag:None,2017-08-29:/thirty-years-of-land-usecover-change-in-the-caribbean-assessing-the-relationship-between-urbanization-and-mangrove-loss-in-roatan-honduras.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="first page" class="img-responsive align-right" src="{{&amp;quot;assets/images/publications/Tuholske2017_1987.png&amp;quot; | absolute_url}}" width="50%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;: Despite increasing biophysical and anthropogenic threats to Caribbean island ecosystems, relatively few studies have used remote sensing to estimate rates of land use/cover change (LUCC) for Caribbean Islands. Mangroves provide vital protection to Caribbean island coastline, substantial economic benefit, and crucial habitat for surrounding reef ecosystems. However, Caribbean island mangroves are shrinking as urban areas expand. Such deforestation is of considerable global environmental concern. This study applies a random forest classifier to thirteen Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) scenes from 1985 to 2015 covering Roatán, Honduras, the largest of the Bay Islands. Results indicate that urban area increased by 982.8 ha (227.7%), with 224.1 ha (−19.1%) of mangroves converted to urban areas. Island-wide and outside of protected areas, a significant relationship was found between urban expansion and mangrove loss. Designated protected reserves have stemmed cutting of mangroves and allowed mangroves to fully recover following Hurricane Mitch in 1998. However, despite being illegal under national and international laws, mangrove loss is accelerating outside of protected areas to accommodate growing urban area and tourism infrastructure. This research suggests that rapid urbanization and tourism development in the Caribbean may decrease island ecosystem resiliency to environmental stressors and impair the sustainability of tourism development.&lt;/p&gt;
