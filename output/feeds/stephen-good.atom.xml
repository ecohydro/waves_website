&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;:Interannual variation in precipitation totals is a critical factor governing the year-to-year availability of water resources, yet the connection between interannual precipitation variability and underlying event- and season-scale precipitation variability remains unclear. In this study, tropical and midlatitude precipitation characteristics derived from extensive station records and high-frequency satellite observations were analyzed to attribute the fraction of interannual variability arising as a result of individual variability in precipitation event intensity, frequency, and seasonality, as well as the cross-correlation between these factors at the global scale. This analysis demonstrates that variability in the length of the wet season is the most important factor globally, causing 52% of the total interannual variability, while variation in the intensity of individual rainfall events contributes 31% and variability in interstorm wait times contributes only 17%. Spatial patterns in the contribution of each of these intra-annual rainfall characteristics are informative, with regions such as Indonesia and southwestern North America primarily influenced by seasonality, while regions such as the eastern United States, central Africa, and the upper Amazon basin are strongly influenced by storm intensity and frequency. A robust cross-correlation between climate characteristics is identified in the equatorial Pacific, revealing an increased interannual variability over what is expected based on the variability of individual events. This decomposition of interannual variability identifies those regions where accurate representation of daily and seasonal rainfall statistics is necessary to understand and correctly model rainfall variability at longer time scales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephen spent two years prior to coming to Princeton in the Peace Corps, working in the Dominican Republic. Living on $1000 a year prepared him well for graduate work. That and his 2 degrees in Engineering, plus the fact that he can read C code the way the pope reads Latin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen's PhD focused on how water (and/or the lack thereof) interacts with ecosystems and environments, from canopy to continent scale. His main emphasis was on the use of isotopic tracers to partition water vapor fluxes in dryland ecosystems. Stephen received his PhD in 2013. After a postdoc at the University of Utah working with &lt;a href="http://wateriso.utah.edu/spatial/index.html"&gt;Gabe Bowen&lt;/a&gt;, he is now an &lt;a href="http://bee.oregonstate.edu/stephen-good"&gt;assistant professor at Oregon State University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="_people"></category></entry></feed>
